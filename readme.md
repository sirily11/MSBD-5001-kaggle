# MSBD5001 Individual Project

This repo contains two files, one is jupyter notebook which contains all the code to generate the final result. And the other one is prediction file which contains a list of predictions.

You can view the jupyter notebook online by using

- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Tx3wm21uL87gAIBD0Cudj2AOPpt8vVYZ?usp=sharing)
- [My website](https://notes.sirileepage.com/MSBD5001/project/Individual%20Project/)

Some of the code are copied from my group project which can be found in this [link](https://notes.sirileepage.com/MSBD5001/project/Group%20Project/). And other online references are listed at the begining of the jupyter notebook.

## Datasets:

## How to run

If you open this jupyter notebook directly from google colab, then it should be ready to run. Otherwise, make sure you install tensorflow, scikit-learn, matplotlib to run the notebook. But I prefer to run the notebook directly from Google Colab. Somethimes, Colab may run slower by accident. For example, it may take 1 hour to run the Regression code instead of 20 mins.
